        <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
        <h5 class="me">
          My name is Jorge Robles and I am a professionally licensed K-12 Music
          Teacher in NYS, specializing in instrumental music such as band as well as transitioning to becoming a  Software Engineer.
        </h5>
        <p>
            Hi - I'm Jorge!
            I am a Music Teacher/Public School Educator turned Software Engineer. I grew up in New York City as a first generation son to immigrant parents and always had many passions - music, education for all, and tech. I love to perform music as well as teach anyone who wants to learn more about music, tech, or anything else!

            Currently, I am working on a second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

            I previously worked professionally as a certified public school teacher for over two years. Although I no longer work in the public sector, I will forever be a big advocate for inclusion and diversity in both tech and in music. My mission is to help bridge the equity gap and support young students build their future careers in STEM, Music, Education, or whatever they aspire to be by leading through example. I love helping others and mentoring younger people, so I hope to continue that even as a Software Engineer.

            I love meeting new people and learning more about tech, software engineering, coding, and music from others! I would love to talk about your latest project, or watch a cool performance that you just had. Feel free to message me whenever inspiration strikes!
